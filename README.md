# Minging crypto, Optimized for AMD Radeon GPUs


## Requirements
- AMD Radeon GPUs
- Latest official AMDGPU drivers installed
- Windows 10 64bit
* Successfully tested with GPU, [AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT](https://www.amd.com/es/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt) Founder Edition, and PhoenixMiner v5.5c & drivers AMDGPU v[21.3.1](https://drivers.amd.com/drivers/radeon-software-adrenalin-2020-21.3.1-win10-64bit-mar24.exe)

## Mining
Clone the repository on your computer, run the .bat script you want to mine, and you're done. 

Remember to add exception or disable the antivirus or windows defender, as the PhoenixMiner mining program can give you problems. 

The unMineable mining pool is used, my referral code is already included in the .bat scripts so that they only charge a 0.75% network commission, instead of 1%.

## Testing
With this configuration, the GPU remains stable during mining with 93W of power consumption, at 1,800Mhz frequency and only 750mV, in a stock GPU without modifying the BIOS, the maximum temperature reached is 57° Celsius and the junction temperature is 62°, with 55% fan power. 

You can modify these values at your own risk, if you get a green screen and the computer crashes you should slightly adjust the clock frequency as well as the mV voltage.
